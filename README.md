# (Personal) podcast feeds

Podcasts are a great way to engage with discrete, sequential audio content.

This repo contains unofficial podcast RSS feeds for a selection of audio content found online.


## Generating the podcast RSS feeds

```
# Project setup
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# Each folder in the Podcasts directory will feature a `podcast_generator.py` file.
# Run this to generate the RSS feed.
```
